# Draw In Loop â€“ Aseprite Extension

An Aseprite extension that lets you keep drawing while your animation frames play in a loop.  
It works by automating the **"Next Frame"** action, so you can continue sketching without stopping playback.

----------

## Features

-   Loop through animation frames automatically.
    
-   Adjustable playback speed (in milliseconds).
    
-   Add multiple empty cells at once.

2.  Double-click the file to install it in Aseprite.
    

----------

## Usage

1.  Open your Aseprite project.
    
2.  Go to **Frame -> Draw In Loop**.
    
3.  Adjust the speed and settings in the dialog.
